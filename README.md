## Abstract
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are typically used to study glassy systems such as confined water in carbon nanotubes (CNT). One of the most important parameters to characterize glassy systems is the relaxation time. The Intermediate scattering function (ISF) which is directly correlated to the structural relaxation time can be computed directly from the trajectory obtained from MD by fitting the ISF curves to the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) function. The advantage of MD data over scattering experiments is the access to very low wave numbers that are usually inaccessible in experiments. However, to cover the whole range of time required to plot the ISF, long simulations (40 ns)<sup>1</sup> sometimes are required. Here, we attempt to predict the relaxation time using supervised learning algorithms on the trajectories obtained from MD. The parameters used in the model are the diameter of the CNT, density of water, temperature and the average displacement of the water molecules up to the divergence time, which is the time where a ISF curve start to differentiate from another curve; and the initial cage relaxation time obtained from cage correlation functions (CCF). This methodology will help to reduce computational time in the study of glassy systems and in particular in the estimation of the relaxation time.
